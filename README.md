# Hi, I'm ForYes 🫱

Welcome to my overview 👋

I'm a senior high school student living in China.
I have a little experience in C++ and web development.
And I strive to write clean, maintainable code though large mountains of shit are always produced underneath my fingerpoints 😂

And I'm currently busy schooling and dealing with my homework as well as preparations for the exam. Thus I seldom have spare time on coding 😭

By the way, a Chinese Chess AI project called Chess98 https://github.com/StarlightChessOrg/Chess98 is now developing by my friend and me. If you are interested in that, welcome to have a look 😆

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

I'm a noob as a matter of fact and just able to use them for a little 😭:

- Languages: JS, Lua, C++, Python, ...
- Development Preferences: Web, AI, Cross-Platform, ...
- Interested in: PyTorch, Full-Stack Web, Windows, ...

## 🚀 Projects

I don't have any inspiring projects of my own 😭,
but here is one that I made efforts
(the core algorithm was written by my friend, 'cause I'm too weak to learn difficult things):
- Chess98 https://github.com/StarlightChessOrg/Chess98
